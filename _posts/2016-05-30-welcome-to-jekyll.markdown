And on this nice and shiny day of summer I took decision to move ahead of old blog powered by Wordpress to this new one powered by [github][github] pages with an essence of [Jekyll][jekyll]. There is very slight chances that I'll repost my old posts in this blog as there are many reasons:

* First and foremost, I am too lazy to do so.
* BlackBerry 10 is long gone
* Firefox OS has been shut down. So, as a result there is no use to build custom __gaia__.(If still you are interested ping me on IRC \[sudoname: foxt7ot\])

So what exactly you can find in this blog? Mumble-Jumbled posts, yeah that's right. Post on technologies, religions, Movies and what not.
